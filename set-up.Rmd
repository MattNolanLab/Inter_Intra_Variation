# R Markdown {-}

Load packages needed by other scripts.

```{r cars}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggthemes)
library(optimx)
library(lme4)
library(MuMIn)
library(cowplot)
library(GGally)
```

Set parameter variables.
```{r}
# Save tables as jpegs. Set as 1 to do this.
# Code will take a lot longer to run.
stajpeg <- 0
```

Function for quick setup. Use this to avoid manually running these scripts. Note, source'd code is evaluated in the global environment by default, so results are available to work with.
```{r}
ksource <- function(x, ...) {
  library(knitr)
  source(purl(x, output = tempfile()), ...)
}

quick_setup <- function() {
  ksource("Functions.Rmd", echo = TRUE)
  ksource("LoadData.Rmd")
  ksource("Props_mixed_model.Rmd")
  }
```
