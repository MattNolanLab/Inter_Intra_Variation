## Goals

To reduce the dimensionality of the dataset. To test explore how dorsoventral location and mouse identity map onto each dimension. To evaluate linear models generated using the principal components.

Carry out PCA.




Plot components vs dosrosventral location. Colour code mouse ID.





Plot components seperately for each mouse.
