Data readme

datatable_SC_missingDOBs.txt is the original data file generated by HP. It is called datatable.txt here. 

In this folder datatable.txt has missing DOBs added. These were obtained after checking other records with DG. Comments as follows.

20131106. Hugh wrote in his lab book that the box said DOB 2/9/13 (65 days old) for this mouse, however he asked for ~5 weeks so he suspects that the DOB should have been 2/10/13, which would have made it 35 days old. 

For this we use the age 35 days old. The mouse would have looked unusally large if it was 65 days old, which it did not.
